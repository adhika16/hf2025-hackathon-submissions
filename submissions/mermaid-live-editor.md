## Project Title
Mermaid Live Editor

<!--
CodeCapture
-->

## Project Description    
I built a free, open-source live editor for creating Mermaid diagrams. The application allows users to write Mermaid syntax in an editor, render diagrams in real-time, and share or export them. It features templates for various diagram types (flowcharts, Gantt charts, sequence diagrams, etc.), zoom/pan controls, and a clean, responsive UI built with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
I wanted to create a simple, accessible tool for anyone to create professional diagrams without needing complex software. Mermaid is powerful but often requires setup; this live editor makes it instant and collaborative. As a free tool, it democratizes diagram creation for developers, educators, and teams.
